# snap-and-clarifai

1. When watching video or YouTube, tab the app and it will take video snapshot from the video frame .
2. hit "Predict" and the image will parse to the Claifai API. And return celebrity names.
3. Backend javascript do the part of snapshot, where popup.js do the image parsing, analysis and return result.
4. (fixed) I am still working on the 'onclick' event in popup.js 100:103, the links wont render accordingly. For now the remedy is catDiv.innerHTML from popup.js 86 where I insert a tag 'target =  blank' to the src.
5. (fixed) Working on chrome:// address error, background error when open tab in chrome://url
6. (done)  Add drawbox function and some css improvement, working on mouse hover/enter event (to draw specific individual box).
7. Trying to add a (YouTube) button to invoke the popup page.(open the extension(screenshot) through the button. ) This one was a little tricky since Google is not allow open extension through content script.
8. The UI has changed a bit... after clicking the result from popup, the playing video will be minimized and (Youtube) search result
will be shown on the same tab. So user can searching and watching at the same time.
